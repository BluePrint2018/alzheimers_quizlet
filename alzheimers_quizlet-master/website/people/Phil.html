Phil thinks that he’s funny because on his 12th birthday he was hitting fast balls in the batting cage and then he hit his best friend and said a joke where everyone laughed. So now he believes that he is funny. In college Phil had  a rival named Glen Whipple who was the captain of the cheerleading squad who also happened to break dance and performed magic like Phil. Also Phil has a fear of clowns, from finding one dead in the woods.";
