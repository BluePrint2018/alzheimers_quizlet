				<p>We are highschool students that are trying to help you. With Unforgettable you are able to help anyone in your family with alzheimer's disease so that they may never forget about you. All you have to do is input information about your family and how they relevant to them. Then, everyday, they may log into the website, and go through the list of family members, quizzing themselves about who they are and how they fit in. Family is an important part of many people's lives and we want to make sure that those treasured moments are not forgotten.</p>
